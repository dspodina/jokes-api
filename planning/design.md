# Design Random Jokes App Design

The Simple Random Jokes App is designed to provide users with a quick and entertaining way to discover and share jokes fetched from an external API. The design prioritizes simplicity, usability, and a seamless user experience.

## Components

**Joke Display Area:** This area of the app displays the fetched joke to the user. It should be prominently placed at the center of the screen for easy visibility.

**Fetch Button:** A button that triggers the fetching of a new random joke from the API. This button should be intuitively positioned and easily accessible to the user.

**Styling:** Apply basic styling to the app interface to improve visual appeal and readability. Use a clean and modern design with a neutral color palette to maintain simplicity.
